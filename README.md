# Nato-AirCom: Air & Sea Rescue Mission Visualization

This project is a prototype for **mission planning and visualization** of search and rescue (SAR) operations, likely designed for air and sea military or civil rescue scenarios.

---

##  Features
- **Interactive Mission Visualization**  
  Display dynamic maps of missions involving aircraft, ships, and rescue teams.
  
- **Streamlit-based Web Application**  
  Visualize real-time or simulated missions through an intuitive Streamlit web interface.

- **Scenario Simulation**  
  Includes notebooks for simulating air pilot rescue scenarios.

- **Data Sources**  
  Uses CSV datasets representing aircraft coordinates, mission schedules, and SAR activities.
